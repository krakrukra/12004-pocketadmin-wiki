This payload is intended for testing the OS detection mechanism.  
Since this payload does enable the fingerprinter, it is recommended  
to copy existing fingerprint database from /extra/fingerdb/ to the  
device and then, if necessary, add your own fingerprint files there.  
  
You should have some text editor open before inserting the device.  
Based on what the device thinks your OS is, it will type in  
"WINDOWS/LINUX/MAC/OTHER machine detected!"  
This payload also uses HID_ONLY_MODE, so you will need to use the  
MSD-only button to make it show up as a flash drive again.
