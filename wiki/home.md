By default PocketAdmin shows up as a compound device with HID (keyboard)  
and MSD (flash drive) interfaces. For the most basic use, there must be  
a FAT filesystem on the first partition, and in the root directory there  
must be a payload.txt file, which contains plaintext commands that the  
device should execute. These commands will instruct the device to type in  
a specified string of characters, press a particular key combination  
or do some special thing like wait for 500 milliseconds, etc.  

Normally the payload script (payload.txt) is run whenever you plug the  
device into a PC. However, you might not want to run the payload absolutely  
every time. For example, if you just want to edit some files. To prevent  
script execution you would use the MSD-only button. You need to hold it down,  
insert the device, wait around 1 second after that, then release. In that  
case the device will not type anything in, and instead will show up  
as a flash drive (even if you have enabled HID_ONLY_MODE).  

Optionally, you can have a config.txt file alongside the payload.txt.  
This is the file where pre-configuration commands can be placed.  
The device first reads this file, alters it's behavior based on what  
it found inside, and only then moves on to running some payload file.  
  
More advanced features like OS fingerprinter or using a different  
keyboard layout will require some extra files and directories stored on  
the device. You can find more info about that in dedicated wiki pages.
